## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

```
Add link to code of conduct in README.md
```

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

```
Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md
```

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes
- It reads well
- For english language contributions: Has a good score on Grammarly or Hemingway App
